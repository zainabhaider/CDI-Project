# CDI-Project
For this project, my goal was to conduct Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis for the CDC's Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI): Diabetes dataset.
Data set is found here: https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Chronic-Disease-Indicators/U-S-Chronic-Disease-Indicators-Diabetes/f8ti-h92k

**Summary:**
Diabetes is a major public health crisis in the United States, and I wanted to use the CDI dataset to study diabetes health outcomes. First, I performed data cleaning to remove unwanted columns/data and identify questions to answer. I investigated two questions by conducting exploratory data analysis:
- The role of gender and ethnicity differences in diabetes health ouctomes
- The relationship between diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol
Finally, I summarized my findings from these investigations and presented it to Medium:
